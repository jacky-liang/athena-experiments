        <h1>Welcome to the ATHENA Experiment!</h1>
                <p class="lead">This is a 10 minute experiment to gather data about how humans approach productivity. 
								We hope to provide a tool that will allow people to upgrade their personal productivity by learning how each individual likes to work.
								The purpose of this experiment is to gather some preliminary data so that we can analyze the viability of this approach.</p>
                <h3>Instructions:</h3>
                <p class="lead">After completing a short survey, you will be asked to complete two tasks that will switch automatically:</p>
                <p class="lead"><b>Task 1: Typing</b></p>
                <p class="lead">Type the characters that appear on screen and you will recieve points based on the number of words you correctly type.
                                           The more correctly typed words in the limited amount of time, the better.</p>
                <p class="lead"><b>Task 2: Circles</b></p>
                <p class="lead">Drag different colored circles to the other ones of the matching color and size.</p>
                </br>
                <p class="lead">Please do your best in the typing task, with no interruptions from this experiment throughout. The entire process should take about 10 mins once started. </p>
                <p class="lead">Thank you for your participation!</p>
